# 👋 Hi, I'm Koray

I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on **Linux & Cloud Security**.

I build hands-on security labs to understand how systems are hardened, attacked, and defended in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🔐 Security Focus Areas
- Linux server hardening
- SSH security & key-based authentication
- Firewall & network access control
- Brute-force attack detection & prevention
- Log analysis & incident investigation

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Security Labs
📌 **Cloud Security Labs**  
👉 https://github.com/koray-yolcu-sec/cloud-security-labs

Completed labs include:
- Linux user & permission management
- SSH hardening & secure access control
- Firewall configuration (iptables, default-deny)
- Brute-force defense with Fail2Ban
- SSH log analysis & attack detection

---

## 🎯 Career Goal
Seeking **Security / Cloud / SOC Intern** roles where I can apply defensive security skills and continue learning in real environments.
