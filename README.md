# 👋 Hi, I'm Koray

I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on **Linux, Cloud & Security Engineering**.

I build **hands-on security tools and labs** to understand how systems are hardened, misconfigured, attacked, and defended in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🔐 Security Focus Areas
- Linux server hardening
- SSH security & key-based authentication
- Firewall & network access control
- Brute-force attack detection & prevention
- Log analysis & incident investigation
- Cloud security misconfiguration analysis (AWS)

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Security Labs
📌 **Cloud Security Labs**  
👉 https://github.com/koray-yolcu-sec/cloud-security-labs

Completed labs include:
- Linux user & permission management
- SSH hardening & secure access control
- Firewall configuration (iptables, default-deny)
- Brute-force defense with Fail2Ban
- SSH log analysis & attack detection

## 🛠️ Security Tools & Projects

🔹 **AWS Security Scout**  
Terminal-based **AWS Cloud Security Scanner (CSPM)** that detects common misconfigurations and security risks across AWS services.

👉 https://github.com/koray-yolcu-sec/aws-security-scout  

Focus areas:
- IAM, S3, EC2, CloudTrail, KMS, Secrets Manager
- Risk scoring & prioritized findings
- DevSecOps & audit-friendly design

---


🔹 **AltaySec Cloud Security Scanner**  
A **read-only AWS cloud security scanner** that identifies misconfigurations and security risks.

👉 https://github.com/koray-yolcu-sec/altay_cloud_scanner

Focus areas:
- Executive summary
- Risk scoring
- Multi-region support
- JSON / Terminal reporting

---

🔹 **Web-Scan**  
A **passive web security scanning tool** that operates within legal and ethical boundaries.

👉 https://github.com/koray-yolcu-sec/web-scan  

Focus areas:
- OWASP-aligned passive checks
- Web security headers & misconfigurations
- CLI-based, lightweight security analysis

---


## 🎯 Career Goal
Seeking **Security / Cloud / SOC Intern** roles where I can apply defensive security skills, work with real systems, and continue learning in production-like environments.
